Application Programmers Interface (API)
=======================================

The LabCAS backend provides a RESTful API for interacting with the LabCAS system. This API is used by the LabCAS UI to interact with the backend and by other applications to interact with the LabCAS system. Third-party applications can also use the API to interact with LabCAS and its data. For example, the API could be accessed directly by a Python script to download a science data file and run an analysis on it.

The backend API is documented using Postman_ and the `Postman Collection`_ is available for download in Postman and Swagger_ formats.

You can also `browse the API documentation online`_.
