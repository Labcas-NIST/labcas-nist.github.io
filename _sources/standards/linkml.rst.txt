LinkML
======

Every dataset comes with a structure, even when it is only implied. Writing that structure down makes the data easier to share, understand, and reuse. LinkML_ helps you do exactly that by giving you a flexible way to describe your data model, whether you are working with:

• simple TSVs or spreadsheets
• a relational database with many relationships
• JSON documents stored in MongoDB or another document store
• a knowledge graph in Neo4J
• linked data in RDF

With LinkML you can start small—think lightweight semantic dictionaries for tabular data—and grow into rich, interlinked schemas for knowledge graphs and triplestores. The same tooling supports the entire journey, so you can keep refining your schema as your project evolves.
