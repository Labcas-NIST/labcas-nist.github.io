Sphinx Documentation
====================

DELETE THIS FILE.

This is just a demo of the kinds of documentation you can write using Sphinx and the "reStructuredText" markup language. Be sure to `read the Sphinx documentation`_ for more information.

Here is *emphasized* text and **strong emphasis** too. And for ``code samples`` use double-backticks.

You can do lists with stars, dashes, actual bullets (like •), numbers, or number signs:

Bulleted lists:

- Some item
- Another item
    - A sub-item

Numbered lists:

1. First item
2. Second item

You can auto-number them too:

#. First item, auto-numbered
#. Second item, auto-numbered

For code samples, introduce them with a double-colon::

    import sys
    print("Hello, world!")
    sys.exit(0)

Here's a hyperlink to `Google`_. This puts the actual URL at the end of the file, which makes it easier to read.

But some prefer the hyperlink inline, so here'a s link to `Bing <https://www.bing.com/>`_ that demonstrates that.

Headings are lined with symbols; you can use most any symbol you want, but the most common are ``#``, ``*``, ``=``, ``-``, ``^``, and ``"``. For example:

Heading 1
=========

That's a level 1 heading.

Heading 2
---------

That's heading level 2.

Heading 3
^^^^^^^^^

There's a level 3.

There are lots of different admonitions too:

.. attention::

    May I please have your attention.

There are also ``caution``, ``danger``, ``error``, ``hint``, ``important``, ``note``, ``tip``, ``warning``, and ``seealso`` admonitions.
